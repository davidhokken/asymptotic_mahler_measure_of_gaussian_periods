# The asymptotic Mahler measure of Gaussian periods

This Github file provides supplementary material for the paper "The asymptotic Mahler measure of Gaussian periods" by Gunther Cornelissen, David Hokken and Berend Ringeling.

The files are three iPython Notebooks:
- "algorithm-m3-m5-t7" gives an algorithm that establishes the values of $m_3$, $m_5$ and $t_7$; see section 8 in the paper.
- "calculations-with-cyclopolytopes" gives an algorithm to compute the cyclopolytopes and check reflexivity as described in Remark 4.1.1, as well as a check that the transportation polytope $T(3,5)$ is combinatorially, but not polar dual to the cyclopolytope $N_{3 \cdot 5}$. 
- "mahler-measure-pictures" computes $m(C_k)$ numerically and the graphs $\rho_k$ for $k=6,8,10$; see section 7 in the paper.
